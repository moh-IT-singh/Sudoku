# Sudoku Game
Hi! I made this game for a Python project in school.<br />
In this repository, the sudoku_board_solver.py file takes a preformatted file for a sudoku puzzle and outputs a solution.<br />
The sudoku_game.py file uses pygame to make a gui for the game where you can play the game for yourself and then check and see if you have the correct solution.
